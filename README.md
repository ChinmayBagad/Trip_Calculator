# Trip_Calculator


The idea of determining the total amount spent during a trip to Sinhgad Fort and distributing it equally among a group of individuals arose while traveling with friends. The objective is to calculate and divide the expenses fairly among the participants.


DAY:-01---(30/1)
So today i did:-
1. Take the User name and store it in a list and count that list
2. and after that take the user input to access the list.

Day:02---(31/1)

their is only one issue i.e when the user enter number outlist the list created instead of giving error it always crashes
Other than that everyting works fine

2.and after that calculate their sum
3.and display the total amount spend and per person money
